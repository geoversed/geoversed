# About

Undergraduate at UK studying A-Levels. I have a lot on my plate with academics, so there is not much to share yet.

I'm always seeking out new things and learning from mistakes in the past.
- At present, I'm developing a Discord bot written in Python as a free-time project.
- Working with Python and planning on learning Javascript and C in the near future.
- May make random contributions to projects particularly in Python.
- Available on Discord and occasionally on X, Reddit and Quora.
