Undergraduate at UK studying A-Levels. I have a lot on my plate with academics, so there is not much to share yet.

Seeking out new things and learning from mistakes in the past. Currently, I'm working with Python with a few years of experience in the language, with plans to learn JavaScript and C in the future. Gained some experience in web development in academics and scripting too by taking up Arch Linux as my primary OS.

Aspirations to become a networking or software engineer.
